# Global Alignment - Needleman-Wunsch algorithm

The project consists of the implementation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.

In `/input_files` you can find example input files.

In `/output_files` you can find the result.

In order to run the code you must write:

```
python -m needleman_wunsch.py -a fasta_seq_1 -b fasta_seq_2 -c config.txt -o result_file.txt
```
